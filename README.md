## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Amir Cici, a Mechanical Engineer with a Master's degree in Project Management and a newly acquired Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. I'm passionate about leveraging the power of data visualization to simplify complex information and improve decision-making. I believe that well-crafted visuals can transform data into actionable insights, making it easier to understand trends, identify opportunities, and communicate effectively. I enjoy exploring the interplay of visual cues and color to create engaging and impactful presentations of data. I'm currently based in beautiful Melbourne, Australia.
